# SQL Notes: Handling NULL Values When Sorting Data

## How SQL Sorts NULL Values

### Ascending Order (Lowest to Highest)
When you sort data from smallest to biggest, SQL puts NULL values **at the start**.

**Example:**
```
Original: 15, 25, NULL
After sorting (ascending): NULL, 15, 25
```

### Descending Order (Highest to Lowest)
When you sort data from biggest to smallest, SQL puts NULL values **at the end**.

**Example:**
```
Original: 15, 25, NULL
After sorting (descending): 25, 15, NULL
```

### Important to Remember! üß†
NULL doesn't mean "zero" or "lowest value" - it means **NO VALUE**. SQL just places it at the start or end automatically!

---

## The Problem

**Task:** Sort customers from lowest to highest scores, but put NULL values at the end.

This is tricky because SQL naturally puts NULLs at the start when sorting ascending!

## Solution 1: The Lazy Way (Not Recommended) ‚ö†Ô∏è

### How It Works:
Replace NULL with a VERY BIG number so it appears at the end.

```sql
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    Score
FROM Sales.Customers
ORDER BY COALESCE(Score, 9999999) ASC
```

**What COALESCE does:**
- If Score has a value, use that value
- If Score is NULL, replace it with 9999999

### Why This is Called "Lazy":
‚ùå What if someday a score becomes 10000000? (bigger than our replacement)
‚ùå The NULL would appear in the middle, not at the end!
‚ùå We're guessing that 9999999 is big enough

**Think of it like:** Using tape to fix a broken toy. It works now, but might break again later!

## Solution 2: The Professional Way (Recommended) ‚úÖ

### The Smart Trick: Create a Flag!

A **flag** is like a label that says "This is NULL" or "This is NOT NULL"

### Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1:** Create a flag using CASE statement
```sql
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    Score,
    CASE 
        WHEN Score IS NULL THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END AS NullFlag
FROM Sales.Customers
```

**What this means in simple words:**
- If Score is NULL, give it flag = 1
- If Score has a value, give it flag = 0

**Result:**
| CustomerID | Score | NullFlag |
|------------|-------|----------|
| 101        | 15    | 0        |
| 102        | 25    | 0        |
| 103        | NULL  | 1        |
| 104        | 30    | 0        |

---

**Step 2:** Sort by the flag FIRST, then by score

```sql
SELECT 
    CustomerID,
    Score
FROM Sales.Customers
ORDER BY 
    CASE WHEN Score IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
    Score
```

### How This Sorting Works:

1. **First:** Sort by NullFlag (0s come first, 1s come last)
   - All rows with scores (flag = 0) come first
   - All rows with NULL (flag = 1) go to the end

2. **Second:** Within each group, sort by Score
   - Among the 0-flagged rows: sort by actual scores (15, 25, 30...)
   - The 1-flagged rows (NULLs) stay at the end

**Final Result:**
| CustomerID | Score |
|------------|-------|
| 101        | 15    |
| 102        | 25    |
| 104        | 30    |
| 103        | NULL  |

## Comparing Both Methods

### Method 1 (Lazy Way)
```sql
ORDER BY COALESCE(Score, 9999999)
```
‚úÖ Simple and quick
‚ùå Might break if data changes
‚ùå Uses a "guess" number

### Method 2 (Professional Way)
```sql
ORDER BY 
    CASE WHEN Score IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
    Score
```
‚úÖ Always works, no matter what
‚úÖ No guessing needed
‚úÖ Professional and reliable
‚ùå Slightly longer to write

## Visual Example

### Before Sorting:
```
Customer 101: Score = 25
Customer 102: Score = NULL
Customer 103: Score = 15
Customer 104: Score = NULL
Customer 105: Score = 30
```

### After Professional Sorting:
```
Customer 103: Score = 15  ‚Üê Lowest
Customer 101: Score = 25  ‚Üê Middle
Customer 105: Score = 30  ‚Üê Highest
Customer 102: Score = NULL ‚Üê NULLs at end
Customer 104: Score = NULL ‚Üê NULLs at end
```

## Key Takeaways

üéØ **SQL's Default Behavior:**
- Ascending: NULLs at the **start**
- Descending: NULLs at the **end**

üéØ **To Control NULL Position:**
- Use CASE statement to create a flag
- Sort by flag first, then by your actual data

üéØ **Best Practice:**
- Always use the professional method (CASE statement)
- Avoid using big numbers as replacements

---

## Memory Trick üß†

**"Flag it First, Sort it Second!"**

When you want NULLs in a specific place:
1. Create a flag (0 or 1)
2. Sort by flag first
3. Sort by actual data second

## Practice Question

**Question:** You have test scores: 85, NULL, 92, 78, NULL. You want to sort from lowest to highest with NULLs at the end. Which method is better?

**Answer:** Use the CASE statement method! Create a flag where NULL = 1, and sort by the flag first, then by score. This way, you'll get: 78, 85, 92, NULL, NULL.
