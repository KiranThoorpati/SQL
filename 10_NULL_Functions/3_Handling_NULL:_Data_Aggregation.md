# Handling NULLs Before Calculations - Simple Notes

## The Problem with NULL in Calculations

### What Happens When We Calculate Averages?

**Example: Three Sales Values**
- Sale 1: 15
- Sale 2: 25
- Sale 3: NULL

**What SQL Does:**
```
Average = (15 + 25) √∑ 2 = 20
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **SQL completely IGNORES the NULL value!**

It only counts the values that exist (15 and 25), not the NULL.

## How Aggregate Functions Handle NULL

**Aggregate Functions** = Functions that do calculations on multiple rows (like counting, adding, averaging)

| Function | How it Treats NULL | Example |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **SUM** | Ignores NULL | Sum of 10, 20, NULL = 30 |
| **AVG** (Average) | Ignores NULL | Average of 10, 20, NULL = 15 |
| **COUNT(column_name)** | Ignores NULL | Count of 10, 20, NULL = 2 |
| **MIN** (Minimum) | Ignores NULL | Min of 10, 20, NULL = 10 |
| **MAX** (Maximum) | Ignores NULL | Max of 10, 20, NULL = 20 |
| **COUNT(*)** | ‚úÖ Counts NULL rows | Count of 10, 20, NULL = 3 |

### Special Note about COUNT:
- `COUNT(column_name)` ‚Üí Counts only non-NULL values
- `COUNT(*)` ‚Üí Counts ALL rows, including NULLs

## Why This Matters for Business

### Scenario: Understanding NULL as ZERO

Sometimes in business, NULL means "zero" or "nothing happened," not "unknown."

**Example: Student Test Scores**
- Student A: 80
- Student B: 90
- Student C: NULL (didn't take the test = 0)

**Without handling NULL:**
```
Average = (80 + 90) √∑ 2 = 85
```
Only 2 students counted!

**After replacing NULL with 0:**
```
Average = (80 + 90 + 0) √∑ 3 = 56.7
```
All 3 students counted! ‚úÖ

The second average is more accurate if your teacher wants to count missing tests as zero!

## The Solution: Handle NULLs BEFORE Calculating

### Use COALESCE or ISNULL to Replace NULL with 0

**Before:**
```sql
AVG(score)
-- This ignores NULL values
```

**After:**
```sql
AVG(COALESCE(score, 0))
-- This treats NULL as 0
```

---

## Real Example: Customer Scores

### The Data:

| Customer ID | Score |
|------------|-------|
| 1 | 600 |
| 2 | 700 |
| 3 | 500 |
| 4 | 200 |
| 5 | NULL |

---

### Method 1: Without Handling NULL (Wrong for some businesses)

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    score,
    AVG(score) OVER() AS average_scores
FROM customers
```

**Result:**
- Average = (600 + 700 + 500 + 200) √∑ 4 = **500**
- NULL is ignored
- Only 4 customers counted

---

### Method 2: Handling NULL as ZERO (More Accurate)

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    score,
    COALESCE(score, 0) AS score_two,
    AVG(COALESCE(score, 0)) OVER() AS average_scores_two
FROM customers
```

**What happens:**
1. COALESCE changes NULL to 0
2. Now we have: 600, 700, 500, 200, 0

**Result:**
- Average = (600 + 700 + 500 + 200 + 0) √∑ 5 = **400**
- All 5 customers counted
- More accurate if NULL means "zero" in your business!

## When Should You Handle NULLs?

### ‚úÖ Handle NULLs BEFORE calculations when:
1. NULL means "zero" in your business
2. You want to include everyone in the count
3. You're doing aggregations like SUM, AVG, COUNT
4. You need accurate business reports

### ‚ùå Don't handle NULLs when:
1. NULL means "we don't know" or "data missing"
2. Including NULL as 0 would give wrong information
3. Business wants to see only actual values

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Steps to Handle NULLs in Calculations:

**Step 1:** Understand what NULL means for your business
- Does NULL = 0 (nothing)?
- Or NULL = unknown (we don't know)?

**Step 2:** If NULL should be 0, replace it BEFORE calculating
```sql
COALESCE(column_name, 0)
```

**Step 3:** Then do your calculation
```sql
AVG(COALESCE(column_name, 0))
SUM(COALESCE(column_name, 0))
COUNT(COALESCE(column_name, 0))
```

## Practice Example: Class Test Scores

**Scenario:** Teacher wants average including students who were absent (count them as 0)

**Data:**
| Student | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Ram | 85 |
| Sita | 90 |
| Mohan | NULL (absent) |

**Wrong way (ignores NULL):**
```sql
SELECT AVG(score) FROM students
-- Result: 87.5 (only Ram and Sita counted)
```

**Right way (treats NULL as 0):**
```sql
SELECT AVG(COALESCE(score, 0)) FROM students
-- Result: 58.3 (all 3 students counted)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. üéØ **SQL ignores NULL** in most calculations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX)

2. üéØ **Always handle NULLs BEFORE aggregations** if NULL should mean "zero"

3. üéØ **Use COALESCE or ISNULL** to replace NULL with 0 before calculating

4. üéØ **Ask your business**: What does NULL mean in this case?

5. üéØ **Different results**: Ignoring NULL vs treating it as 0 gives different answers!

---

## Remember:
**Handle NULLs FIRST, then Calculate!** This ensures your results match what the business needs! üìä‚úÖ
