# Understanding NULLs in SQL - Study Notes

## What are NULLs?

**NULL** is a special marker in SQL that means:
- There is **no value**
- The value is **missing**
- The value is **unknown**

### Important: What NULL is NOT
- NULL â‰  Zero (0)
- NULL â‰  Empty string ("")
- NULL â‰  Blank spaces ("   ")

**Think of it this way:** If someone asks your favorite color and you haven't decided yet, you wouldn't say "zero" or leave it blank - you'd say "I don't know." That's what NULL represents!

## Why Use NULLs?

Using NULLs in your database helps in two ways:
1. **Saves storage space** - Instead of storing fake values
2. **Better performance** - Your queries run faster

## Functions to Handle NULLs

### 1. Replace NULL with a Value
If you want to change NULL to something else:

- **COALESCE()** - Replaces NULL with a value you choose
- **ISNULL()** - Same as COALESCE, replaces NULL with a value

**Example:** If a student's grade is NULL, replace it with "Not Graded"

### 2. Replace a Value with NULL
If you want to change a value to NULL:

- **NULLIF()** - Replaces a specific value with NULL

**Example:** If someone enters "Unknown" as a phone number, change it to NULL

### 3. Check if Something is NULL
To find out if a value is NULL or not:

- **IS NULL** - Checks if a value is NULL
- **IS NOT NULL** - Checks if a value is NOT NULL

## When Should You Handle NULLs?

You must handle NULLs **BEFORE** doing these tasks:

### 1. **Data Aggregations**
When using functions like:
- Average (AVG)
- Sum (SUM)
- Maximum (MAX)
- Minimum (MIN)

**Why?** If you add NULL to numbers, the result might be wrong!

### 2. **Mathematical Operations**
When doing math or joining text:
- Adding numbers: 5 + NULL = ?
- Joining strings: "Hello" + NULL = ?

**Why?** NULL can mess up your calculations!

### 3. **Joins**
When combining data from different tables.

**Why?** NULL values might not match properly!

### 4. **Sorting Data**
When arranging data in order (A to Z, smallest to largest).

**Why?** NULLs might appear in unexpected places!

## Special Join Types with NULLs

By combining **joins** and **IS NULL**, we can create special joins:

### Left Anti-Join
- Takes data from the left table
- **Excludes** matching rows using IS NULL
- Shows only non-matching records

### Right Anti-Join
- Takes data from the right table
- **Excludes** matching rows using IS NULL
- Shows only non-matching records

**Think of it like:** Finding students who did NOT submit homework (anti-join finds who's missing!)

## Using NULLs for Data Standards

You can use NULL functions to set rules for your data:

**Example Standards:**
- If phone number is missing â†’ Use NULL
- If address is missing â†’ Use "Unknown"
- If email is missing â†’ Use default value

This keeps your data **consistent** and **organized**!

## Key Takeaways

âœ… NULL means "no value" or "unknown" - it's different from zero or empty

âœ… Always handle NULLs before doing calculations, joins, or sorting

âœ… Use COALESCE, ISNULL, and NULLIF functions to work with NULLs

âœ… IS NULL and IS NOT NULL help you find missing data

âœ… Handling NULLs properly makes your database faster and more accurate
