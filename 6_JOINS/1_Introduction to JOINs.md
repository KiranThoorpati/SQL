# Understanding SQL JOINs - Introduction

## What is Combining Tables?

Imagine you have two notebooks with different information. Sometimes you need information from **both** notebooks together! SQL helps you combine tables in two ways:

### 1. Combining COLUMNS (Side by Side) ‚Üí **JOINs**
### 2. Combining ROWS (Stacking Up) ‚Üí **Set Operators**

---

## Two Methods to Combine Tables

| Method | What It Does | Result |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **JOINs** | Puts columns side by side | **Wider** table |
| **Set Operators** | Stacks rows on top of each other | **Longer** table |

## Understanding JOINs (Combining Columns)

When you use JOINs, SQL calls the tables:
- **Left Table** - The first table (Table A)
- **Right Table** - The second table (Table B)

**Visual:**
```
Table A          Table B          Result (Joined)
[Data] ----JOIN----> [Data]  =  [Data A | Data B]
(Left)              (Right)      (Side by Side)
```

---

## Types of JOINs

**Basic JOINs:**
1. **INNER JOIN** - Only matching data
2. **LEFT JOIN** - All from left + matching from right
3. **RIGHT JOIN** - All from right + matching from left
4. **FULL JOIN** - Everything from both tables

**Advanced JOINs:**
- Focus on **unmatched** data (we'll learn these later!)

---

## What Are Set Operators? (Combining Rows)

**Types:**
1. **UNION** - Combines unique rows
2. **UNION ALL** - Combines all rows (including duplicates)
3. **EXCEPT** - Rows in first table but not in second
4. **INTERSECT** - Only rows that appear in both

**Rule:** Both tables must have the **same number of columns**!

---

## Simple JOIN Example

**Table: customers**
| CustomerID | Name |
|------------|---------|
| 1 | Maria |
| 2 | John |
| 3 | Sarah |
| 4 | Martin |

**Table: customer_countries**
| CustomerID | Country |
|------------|---------|
| 1 | Germany |
| 2 | USA |
| 4 | Germany |

**The KEY Column:** CustomerID appears in **both** tables - this connects them!

---

### How JOIN Works (Step by Step)

**Step 1:** Find the common column (CustomerID)

**Step 2:** Match the IDs:
- ID 1: Maria ‚Üí Germany ‚úì
- ID 2: John ‚Üí USA ‚úì
- ID 3: Sarah ‚Üí No match ‚ùå
- ID 4: Martin ‚Üí Germany ‚úì

**Step 3:** Combine the matched rows

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT customers.Name, customer_countries.Country
FROM customers
INNER JOIN customer_countries
ON customers.CustomerID = customer_countries.CustomerID;
```

**Expected Output:**
| Name | Country |
|---------|---------|
| Maria | Germany |
| John | USA |
| Martin | Germany |

**Note:** Sarah is not shown because ID 3 has no match in the second table!

## Why Do We Use JOINs?

### Reason 1: **Recombine Scattered Data**

In real databases, information about one topic is often split across multiple tables!

**Example:** Customer information might be in:
- `customers` table (names, emails)
- `addresses` table (street, city, zip code)
- `orders` table (what they bought)
- `reviews` table (their ratings)

**Solution:** JOIN all 4 tables to see the **complete picture**!

### Real-World Example: Student Information

**Table: students**
| StudentID | Name | Class |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Rahul | 7A |
| 2 | Priya | 7B |
| 3 | Amit | 7A |

**Table: student_marks**
| StudentID | Subject | Marks |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Math | 85 |
| 2 | Math | 92 |
| 3 | Math | 78 |

**Query:** Get student names with their marks
```sql
SELECT students.Name, student_marks.Subject, student_marks.Marks
FROM students
INNER JOIN student_marks
ON students.StudentID = student_marks.StudentID;
```

**Expected Output:**
| Name | Subject | Marks |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Rahul | Math | 85 |
| Priya | Math | 92 |
| Amit | Math | 78 |

**Awesome!** Now we see names AND marks together! üéØ

---

### Reason 2: **Data Enrichment** (Adding Extra Info)

Sometimes you have your main table, but you want **one extra piece of information** from another table.

**Example:**

**Main Table: customers**
| CustomerID | Name | CountryCode |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Arjun | IN |
| 2 | Sarah | US |
| 3 | Emma | UK |

**Reference Table: countries**
| CountryCode | ZipCode |
|-------------|---------|
| IN | 500001 |
| US | 10001 |
| UK | SW1A |

**Query:** Add zip codes to customer data
```sql
SELECT customers.Name, customers.CountryCode, countries.ZipCode
FROM customers
INNER JOIN countries
ON customers.CountryCode = countries.CountryCode;
```

**Expected Output:**
| Name | CountryCode | ZipCode |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Arjun | IN | 500001 |
| Sarah | US | 10001 |
| Emma | UK | SW1A |

Now our customer table is **enriched** with zip code information! ‚ú®

---

### Reason 3: **Checking Existence** (Filter Based on Another Table)

Sometimes you want to check if your data **exists** (or doesn't exist) in another table.

**Example:**

**Table: customers**
| CustomerID | Name |
|------------|---------|
| 1 | Rahul |
| 2 | Priya |
| 3 | Amit |
| 4 | Sneha |

**Table: orders**
| OrderID | CustomerID | Product |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 101 | 1 | Laptop |
| 102 | 3 | Phone |

**Question:** Which customers have placed orders?

```sql
SELECT customers.CustomerID, customers.Name
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.CustomerID = orders.CustomerID;
```

**Expected Output:**
| CustomerID | Name |
|------------|-------|
| 1 | Rahul |
| 3 | Amit |

Only Rahul and Amit appear because **only they** have orders! We're not showing order details, just using the orders table to **filter**!

## Visual Understanding: The Circle Diagram

Think of tables as **circles**:

```
    Table A          Table B
    (Left)          (Right)
      ‚óè               ‚óè
```

When you JOIN them, they **overlap**:

```
      ‚óè‚óè‚óè
    ‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè
      ‚óè‚óè‚óè
   (Overlap = Matching data)
```

### Three Possibilities:

1. **Overlap Area** = Data that matches in BOTH tables
2. **Left Circle Only** = Data only in Table A
3. **Right Circle Only** = Data only in Table B

## Requirements for JOINs vs Set Operators

| Feature | JOINs | Set Operators |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Need Key Column?** | ‚úÖ YES (to connect tables) | ‚ùå NO |
| **Same # of Columns?** | ‚ùå NO | ‚úÖ YES (must match) |
| **Result Shape** | Wider (more columns) | Longer (more rows) |

---

## Simple Comparison Example

**Table: class_7a**
| StudentID | Name |
|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Rahul |
| 2 | Priya |

**Table: class_7b**
| StudentID | Name |
|-----------|---------|
| 3 | Amit |
| 4 | Sneha |

### Using Set Operator (UNION - Stacking Rows):
```sql
SELECT * FROM class_7a
UNION
SELECT * FROM class_7b;
```

**Result:**
| StudentID | Name |
|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Rahul |
| 2 | Priya |
| 3 | Amit |
| 4 | Sneha |

**All students in ONE table!** (Rows stacked)

---

### Using JOIN (Adding Columns):

**Table: students**
| StudentID | Name |
|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Rahul |
| 2 | Priya |

**Table: hobbies**
| StudentID | Hobby |
|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Cricket |
| 2 | Drawing |

```sql
SELECT students.Name, hobbies.Hobby
FROM students
INNER JOIN hobbies
ON students.StudentID = hobbies.StudentID;
```

**Result:**
| Name | Hobby |
|---------|---------|
| Rahul | Cricket |
| Priya | Drawing |

**Names and hobbies together!** (Columns side by side)

---

## Key Takeaways

‚úÖ **JOINs combine COLUMNS** (side by side) - wider table

‚úÖ **Set Operators combine ROWS** (stacking) - longer table

‚úÖ **JOINs need a KEY column** to connect tables

‚úÖ **Three main reasons to use JOINs:**
   1. Recombine scattered data
   2. Add extra information (enrichment)
   3. Check if data exists

‚úÖ **Multiple types of JOINs** for different scenarios

## What's Next?

In the following lessons, we'll learn:
- **INNER JOIN** (only matching data)
- **LEFT JOIN** (all from left table)
- **RIGHT JOIN** (all from right table)
- **FULL JOIN** (everything!)

**Remember:** JOINs are like connecting puzzle pieces - you need a matching part (key column) to fit them together! üß©
