# SQL Subquery in JOIN - Simple Guide

## What is a Subquery in JOIN?

A subquery in JOIN lets you **prepare data first**, then join it with another table. It's like doing your homework in rough draft before writing the final copy!

**Think of it like:** Making a list of team scores, THEN matching it with team names - you prepare the scores first, then combine them!

---

## Why Use Subquery in JOIN?

Sometimes you can't join tables directly. You need to:
1. **Calculate** something first (like totals or averages)
2. **Filter** data before joining
3. **Group** data before combining with another table

---

## Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM main_table AS alias1
LEFT JOIN (
    -- Subquery: Prepare data first!
    SELECT columns, aggregations
    FROM another_table
    GROUP BY column
) AS alias2 ON alias1.key = alias2.key;
```

**Important:** The subquery needs an **alias** (nickname)!

## Example 1: Customer Details with Total Orders

**Task:** Show all customer information along with how many orders each customer made.

### Step 1: Get Customer Details

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers;
```

**Output:**
```
customer_id | customer_name | city       | email
------------|---------------|------------|------------------
1           | John Smith    | New York   | john@email.com
2           | Mary Jones    | Chicago    | mary@email.com
3           | Bob Wilson    | Boston     | bob@email.com
4           | Alice Brown   | Seattle    | alice@email.com
5           | Anna Davis    | Miami      | anna@email.com
```

### Step 2: Count Orders per Customer (Separate Query)

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Output:**
```
customer_id | total_orders
------------|-------------
1           | 3
2           | 2
3           | 4
4           | 1
```

*Notice: Customer 5 (Anna) has no orders - not in this list!*

### Step 3: Combine Using Subquery in JOIN ✨

```sql
-- Main Query
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.city,
    c.email,
    o.total_orders
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN (
    -- Subquery: Calculate orders per customer
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_orders
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**Expected Final Output:**
```
customer_id | customer_name | city       | email              | total_orders
------------|---------------|------------|--------------------|-------------
1           | John Smith    | New York   | john@email.com     | 3
2           | Mary Jones    | Chicago    | mary@email.com     | 2
3           | Bob Wilson    | Boston     | bob@email.com      | 4
4           | Alice Brown   | Seattle    | alice@email.com    | 1
5           | Anna Davis    | Miami      | anna@email.com     | NULL
```

**Why LEFT JOIN?** So we don't lose customers who have zero orders (like Anna)!

## Example 2: Students with Average Test Scores

**Task:** Show student details with their average test score.

### Complete Solution:

```sql
SELECT 
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name,
    s.grade,
    avg_scores.average_score
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN (
    -- Subquery: Calculate average score per student
    SELECT 
        student_id,
        AVG(score) AS average_score
    FROM test_scores
    GROUP BY student_id
) AS avg_scores ON s.student_id = avg_scores.student_id
ORDER BY s.student_name;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
student_id | student_name | grade | average_score
-----------|--------------|-------|---------------
1          | Alice        | 7     | 92.5
2          | Bob          | 7     | 78.3
3          | Charlie      | 8     | 85.0
4          | Diana        | 6     | 88.7
5          | Emma         | 8     | NULL
```

*Emma has no test scores yet, so average is NULL*

## Example 3: Products with Total Sales Amount

**Task:** Show all products with their total sales revenue.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.price,
    sales.total_revenue,
    sales.units_sold
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN (
    -- Subquery: Calculate sales per product
    SELECT 
        product_id,
        SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue,
        SUM(quantity) AS units_sold
    FROM order_details
    GROUP BY product_id
) AS sales ON p.product_id = sales.product_id
ORDER BY sales.total_revenue DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
product_id | product_name | price | total_revenue | units_sold
-----------|--------------|-------|---------------|------------
1          | Laptop       | 800   | 12000         | 15
4          | Monitor      | 300   | 6000          | 20
3          | Keyboard     | 75    | 1500          | 20
2          | Mouse        | 25    | 500           | 20
5          | Webcam       | 150   | NULL          | NULL
```

*Webcam hasn't been sold yet*

## Example 4: Teachers with Student Count

**Task:** Show all teachers and how many students they teach.

```sql
SELECT 
    t.teacher_id,
    t.teacher_name,
    t.subject,
    student_count.total_students
FROM teachers t
LEFT JOIN (
    -- Subquery: Count students per teacher
    SELECT 
        teacher_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) AS total_students
    FROM enrollments
    GROUP BY teacher_id
) AS student_count ON t.teacher_id = student_count.teacher_id;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
teacher_id | teacher_name  | subject    | total_students
-----------|---------------|------------|----------------
1          | Mr. Smith     | Math       | 28
2          | Ms. Johnson   | Science    | 32
3          | Mrs. Williams | English    | 25
4          | Mr. Brown     | History    | NULL
```

*Mr. Brown is new and has no students yet*

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### Visual Process:

```
Step 1: Main Table          Step 2: Subquery
┌──────────────┐           ┌──────────────┐
│  Customers   │           │    Orders    │
│              │           │   (grouped)  │
│ ID | Name    │           │ ID | Count   │
│ 1  | John    │           │ 1  | 3       │
│ 2  | Mary    │           │ 2  | 2       │
│ 3  | Bob     │           │ 3  | 4       │
│ 4  | Alice   │           │ 4  | 1       │
│ 5  | Anna    │           └──────────────┘
└──────────────┘

Step 3: JOIN them together!
        ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ ID | Name  | Orders         │
│ 1  | John  | 3              │
│ 2  | Mary  | 2              │
│ 3  | Bob   | 4              │
│ 4  | Alice | 1              │
│ 5  | Anna  | NULL           │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Why Not Just Use Regular JOIN?

### Problem with Direct JOIN:

```sql
-- ❌ This won't work correctly!
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name;
```

**Problem:** This loses customers with no orders! Anna disappears!

### Solution with Subquery:

```sql
-- ✅ This works correctly!
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    o.total_orders
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**Benefit:** Keeps all customers, even those with no orders!

## Real-World Example: Library System

**Task:** Show all books with how many times they've been borrowed.

```sql
SELECT 
    b.book_id,
    b.book_title,
    b.author,
    b.category,
    borrow_stats.times_borrowed,
    borrow_stats.currently_borrowed
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN (
    -- Subquery: Count borrows per book
    SELECT 
        book_id,
        COUNT(*) AS times_borrowed,
        SUM(CASE WHEN return_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS currently_borrowed
    FROM library_transactions
    GROUP BY book_id
) AS borrow_stats ON b.book_id = borrow_stats.book_id
ORDER BY borrow_stats.times_borrowed DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
book_id | book_title           | author         | category  | times_borrowed | currently_borrowed
--------|----------------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------
1       | Harry Potter         | J.K. Rowling   | Fantasy   | 45             | 3
4       | Diary of a Wimpy Kid | Jeff Kinney    | Fiction   | 38             | 2
2       | The Hobbit          | J.R.R. Tolkien | Fantasy   | 32             | 1
3       | Charlotte's Web     | E.B. White     | Fiction   | 28             | 0
5       | New Book            | Unknown        | Mystery   | NULL           | NULL
```

## Testing Your Subquery 🔍

Run the subquery separately to check it works:

```sql
-- Highlight and run ONLY the subquery
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

This helps you verify the subquery before using it in the JOIN!

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid ⚠️

### Mistake 1: Forgetting the Alias

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG - No alias for subquery!
SELECT *
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) ON c.customer_id = customer_id;  -- ERROR!

-- ✅ CORRECT - Has alias
SELECT *
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### Mistake 2: Using INNER JOIN Instead of LEFT JOIN

```sql
-- ❌ Loses customers with no orders
INNER JOIN (subquery) ...

-- ✅ Keeps all customers
LEFT JOIN (subquery) ...
```

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Subquery in JOIN = Prepare data before combining**  
✅ **Perfect for calculations and aggregations**  
✅ **Must give subquery an alias**  
✅ **Use LEFT JOIN to keep all records from main table**  
✅ **Subquery runs first, then JOIN happens**  
✅ **Test subquery separately before using in JOIN**  
✅ **Great for avoiding complex GROUP BY issues**

Think of it like cooking: prepare your ingredients (subquery), then combine them (JOIN) to make the final dish! 👨‍🍳🍳
