# SQL Views: Complete Summary Guide

## What is a View?

A **view** is like a **saved question** in your database. It's a virtual table that shows results from a query, but it doesn't actually store any data itself - it just remembers how to fetch the data when you need it.

Think of it like a **window** in your house - you can see outside through it, but the window doesn't contain the trees and sky; it just shows them to you!

## Views vs CTEs vs Tables - Quick Comparison

| Feature | Views | CTEs | Tables |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| **Storage** | No data stored | No data stored | Data stored physically |
| **Reusability** | Many queries | Only one query | Many queries |
| **Speed** | Slower | Slower | Faster |
| **Flexibility** | Very flexible | Limited | Less flexible |
| **Ease of Change** | Very easy | N/A (temporary) | Harder |

---

## Key Advantages of Views

### ‚úÖ **Better than CTEs because:**
- Can be reused in multiple queries
- Reduce complexity across the whole project
- CTEs only work within one query

### ‚úÖ **Better than Tables because:**
- Very flexible and easy to change
- Don't take up storage space
- Changes reflect immediately

### ‚ùå **Tables are Better than Views when:**
- You need maximum speed/performance
- Data doesn't change frequently

## The 6 Most Important Use Cases for Views

Let's explore each use case with simple examples!

---

## Use Case 1: Central Business Logic (Avoid Repetition)

**Problem:** You keep writing the same calculation over and over.

### Example Setup
```sql
-- Create a products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    cost_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    selling_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    units_sold INT
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO products VALUES
(1, 'Notebook', 20.00, 40.00, 150),
(2, 'Pen', 5.00, 10.00, 500),
(3, 'Eraser', 3.00, 7.00, 300),
(4, 'Pencil', 4.00, 8.00, 400);
```

**Without View** (repeating logic):
```sql
-- Query 1: Calculate profit
SELECT product_name, 
       (selling_price - cost_price) * units_sold AS total_profit
FROM products;

-- Query 2: Same calculation repeated
SELECT product_name, 
       (selling_price - cost_price) * units_sold AS total_profit
FROM products
WHERE units_sold > 200;
```

**With View** (write once, use many times):
```sql
-- Create view with business logic
CREATE VIEW product_profits AS
SELECT 
    product_id,
    product_name,
    cost_price,
    selling_price,
    units_sold,
    (selling_price - cost_price) AS profit_per_unit,
    (selling_price - cost_price) * units_sold AS total_profit
FROM products;

-- Now use it easily
SELECT * FROM product_profits;
```

**Output:**
```
product_id | product_name | cost_price | selling_price | units_sold | profit_per_unit | total_profit
-----------|--------------|------------|---------------|------------|----------------|-------------
1          | Notebook     | 20.00      | 40.00         | 150        | 20.00          | 3000.00
2          | Pen          | 5.00       | 10.00         | 500        | 5.00           | 2500.00
3          | Eraser       | 3.00       | 7.00          | 300        | 4.00           | 1200.00
4          | Pencil       | 4.00       | 8.00          | 400        | 4.00           | 1600.00
```

**Simple queries now:**
```sql
-- High profit products
SELECT * FROM product_profits WHERE total_profit > 2000;
```

**Output:**
```
product_id | product_name | cost_price | selling_price | units_sold | profit_per_unit | total_profit
-----------|--------------|------------|---------------|------------|----------------|-------------
1          | Notebook     | 20.00      | 40.00         | 150        | 20.00          | 3000.00
2          | Pen          | 5.00       | 10.00         | 500        | 5.00           | 2500.00
```

## Use Case 2: Hide Complex Database Structure

**Problem:** Your real database has many complicated tables joined together.

### Example Setup
```sql
-- Complex tables with technical names
CREATE TABLE tbl_student_master (
    std_id INT,
    std_fname VARCHAR(30),
    std_lname VARCHAR(30),
    class_fk INT
);

CREATE TABLE tbl_class_ref (
    class_pk INT,
    class_code VARCHAR(10),
    teacher_fk INT
);

CREATE TABLE tbl_teacher_info (
    teacher_pk INT,
    teacher_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO tbl_student_master VALUES
(1, 'Rahul', 'Sharma', 101),
(2, 'Priya', 'Patel', 101),
(3, 'Amit', 'Kumar', 102);

INSERT INTO tbl_class_ref VALUES
(101, '7A', 1),
(102, '7B', 2);

INSERT INTO tbl_teacher_info VALUES
(1, 'Mrs. Gupta'),
(2, 'Mr. Singh');
```

**Create Simple View** (hide complexity):
```sql
CREATE VIEW student_info AS
SELECT 
    s.std_id AS student_id,
    CONCAT(s.std_fname, ' ', s.std_lname) AS student_name,
    c.class_code AS class,
    t.teacher_name AS class_teacher
FROM tbl_student_master s
JOIN tbl_class_ref c ON s.class_fk = c.class_pk
JOIN tbl_teacher_info t ON c.teacher_fk = t.teacher_pk;
```

**Now users see simple names:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM student_info;
```

**Output:**
```
student_id | student_name  | class | class_teacher
-----------|---------------|-------|---------------
1          | Rahul Sharma  | 7A    | Mrs. Gupta
2          | Priya Patel   | 7A    | Mrs. Gupta
3          | Amit Kumar    | 7B    | Mr. Singh
```

Users don't need to know about `tbl_student_master`, `std_fk`, or complex joins!

---

## Use Case 3: Security & Data Protection

**Problem:** Some data should be hidden from certain users.

### Example Setup
```sql
-- Sensitive employee data
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(30),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    address VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'Rajesh Kumar', 'IT', 50000.00, '9876543210', '123 MG Road, Mumbai'),
(2, 'Sneha Reddy', 'HR', 45000.00, '9876543211', '456 Park Street, Delhi'),
(3, 'Arjun Mehta', 'Sales', 40000.00, '9876543212', '789 Lake Road, Bangalore');
```

**Create Public View** (hide salary and personal info):
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_directory AS
SELECT 
    emp_id,
    emp_name,
    department
FROM employees;
```

**Everyone can safely see:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_directory;
```

**Output:**
```
emp_id | emp_name      | department
-------|---------------|------------
1      | Rajesh Kumar  | IT
2      | Sneha Reddy   | HR
3      | Arjun Mehta   | Sales
```

Salary and personal details are protected!

**Create Manager View** (show salary but not personal info):
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_payroll AS
SELECT 
    emp_id,
    emp_name,
    department,
    salary
FROM employees;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_payroll;
```

**Output:**
```
emp_id | emp_name      | department | salary
-------|---------------|------------|----------
1      | Rajesh Kumar  | IT         | 50000.00
2      | Sneha Reddy   | HR         | 45000.00
3      | Arjun Mehta   | Sales      | 40000.00
```

## Use Case 4: Flexibility to Change Database Structure

**Problem:** If you change table names/structure, all queries break.

### Example
```sql
-- Original table
CREATE TABLE student_records (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    marks INT
);

INSERT INTO student_records VALUES
(1, 'Aarav', 85),
(2, 'Diya', 92);

-- Create stable view
CREATE VIEW students AS
SELECT id, name, marks FROM student_records;
```

**Users always query the view:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

**Output:**
```
id | name  | marks
---|-------|------
1  | Aarav | 85
2  | Diya  | 92
```

**Now you can change the physical table:**
```sql
-- Rename table (behind the scenes)
ALTER TABLE student_records RENAME TO tbl_student_data;

-- Update view to point to new table
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW students AS
SELECT id, name, marks FROM tbl_student_data;
```

**Users' queries still work!**
```sql
SELECT * FROM students;  -- Still works perfectly!
```

## Quick Reference: When to Use Views

| Situation | Use View? |
|-----------|-----------|

| Need to hide sensitive data | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Simplify complex joins | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Need maximum speed | ‚ùå No (use table) |
| Multi-language interface | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Data warehouse marts | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Protecting database structure changes | ‚úÖ Yes |

## Summary

**Views are virtual tables that:**
- üìù Store queries, not data
- üîÑ Update automatically when base tables change
- üöÄ Make your database more flexible
- üõ°Ô∏è Provide security and simplicity
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Promote reusability across projects

Views are like smart windows into your database - they show you exactly what you need to see, exactly how you need to see it, without duplicating or changing the original data!
