# Understanding SQL TOP/LIMIT Clause

## What is TOP?

**TOP** (also called **LIMIT** in some databases) is a keyword in SQL that controls how many rows you want to see in your results. It's like saying "show me only the first 5 items" from a list!

Think of it like taking only the top 3 books from a stack - you decide how many you want!

---

## Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT TOP number column_name
FROM table_name;
```

**Important:** TOP comes right after SELECT, before column names!

---

## Example 1: Getting Limited Rows

**Table: customers**
| ID | Name | Country | Score |
|----|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Alice | Germany | 450 |
| 2 | Bob | USA | 380 |
| 3 | Charlie | UK | 470 |
| 4 | David | Germany | 420 |
| 5 | Emma | USA | 430 |

**Task:** Get only 3 customers.

```sql
SELECT TOP 3 *
FROM customers;
```

**Expected Output:**
| ID | Name | Country | Score |
|----|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Alice | Germany | 450 |
| 2 | Bob | USA | 380 |
| 3 | Charlie | UK | 470 |

**Explanation:** SQL stops after the first 3 rows - simple as that!

---

## Important: Row Numbers vs Your Data

**Remember:** TOP works based on **row position**, NOT on your data values!

- Row numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... (technical, invisible)
- ID numbers: Your actual data

TOP 3 means "give me the first 3 rows," regardless of what IDs they have!

---

## Example 2: TOP with ORDER BY (Most Powerful!)

**Task:** Find the top 3 customers with the **highest scores**.

**Step 1:** First, sort by score (highest to lowest)
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY Score DESC;
```

**After Sorting:**
| ID | Name | Country | Score |
|----|---------|---------|-------|
| 3 | Charlie | UK | 470 |
| 1 | Alice | Germany | 450 |
| 5 | Emma | USA | 430 |
| 4 | David | Germany | 420 |
| 2 | Bob | USA | 380 |

**Step 2:** Now add TOP 3
```sql
SELECT TOP 3 *
FROM customers
ORDER BY Score DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**
| ID | Name | Country | Score |
|----|---------|---------|-------|
| 3 | Charlie | UK | 470 |
| 1 | Alice | Germany | 450 |
| 5 | Emma | USA | 430 |

**Magic!** We got the 3 customers with highest scores! ⭐

---

## Example 3: Finding Lowest Values

**Task:** Get the 2 customers with the **lowest scores**.

```sql
SELECT TOP 2 *
FROM customers
ORDER BY Score ASC;
```

**Expected Output:**
| ID | Name | Country | Score |
|----|---------|---------|-------|
| 2 | Bob | USA | 380 |
| 4 | David | Germany | 420 |

**Explanation:** 
- ORDER BY Score ASC → sorts from lowest to highest
- TOP 2 → takes first 2 rows
- Result: 2 customers with lowest scores!

---

## Example 4: Most Recent Orders

**Table: orders**
| OrderID | CustomerName | OrderDate | Amount |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------|
| 101 | Rahul | 2024-01-15 | 500 |
| 102 | Priya | 2024-03-20 | 750 |
| 103 | Amit | 2024-02-10 | 600 |
| 104 | Sneha | 2024-03-25 | 800 |

**Task:** Find the 2 most recent orders.

```sql
SELECT TOP 2 *
FROM orders
ORDER BY OrderDate DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**
| OrderID | CustomerName | OrderDate | Amount |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------|
| 104 | Sneha | 2024-03-25 | 800 |
| 102 | Priya | 2024-03-20 | 750 |

**Explanation:** DESC means newest dates first, TOP 2 gives us the 2 most recent!

## Real-World Examples

### Example 5: Top Scorers in Exam

**Table: exam_results**
| StudentID | Name | Subject | Marks |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Arjun | Math | 95 |
| 2 | Kavya | Math | 88 |
| 3 | Rohan | Math | 92 |
| 4 | Diya | Math | 97 |
| 5 | Vikram | Math | 85 |

**Task:** Find top 3 students in Math.

```sql
SELECT TOP 3 StudentID, Name, Marks
FROM exam_results
ORDER BY Marks DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**
| StudentID | Name | Marks |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| 4 | Diya | 97 |
| 1 | Arjun | 95 |
| 3 | Rohan | 92 |

### Example 6: Best-Selling Products

**Table: sales**
| ProductID | ProductName | QuantitySold |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | Notebook | 150 |
| 2 | Pencil | 300 |
| 3 | Eraser | 200 |
| 4 | Ruler | 100 |
| 5 | Sharpener | 250 |

**Task:** Find top 3 best-selling products.

```sql
SELECT TOP 3 ProductName, QuantitySold
FROM sales
ORDER BY QuantitySold DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**
| ProductName | QuantitySold |
|---------------|--------------|
| Pencil | 300 |
| Sharpener | 250 |
| Eraser | 200 |

## TOP + WHERE: Powerful Combination!

**Task:** Find top 2 customers from USA with highest scores.

```sql
SELECT TOP 2 *
FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'USA'
ORDER BY Score DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**
| ID | Name | Country | Score |
|----|---------|---------|-------|
| 5 | Emma | USA | 430 |
| 2 | Bob | USA | 380 |

**Explanation:**
1. WHERE filters only USA customers
2. ORDER BY sorts them by score
3. TOP 2 gives us the best 2

---

## Different Database Syntax

**MySQL/PostgreSQL uses LIMIT instead of TOP:**

```sql
-- SQL Server / MS Access
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM customers;

-- MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 3;
```

Both do the same thing - just different words!

---

## When to Use TOP

✅ **Use TOP when:**
- You want only a few rows from results
- Finding top/bottom performers
- Getting most recent/oldest records
- Making reports (Top 10 lists)
- Website pagination (show 20 items per page)

❌ **Remember:**
- Always use ORDER BY with TOP for meaningful results
- Without ORDER BY, you get random first rows
- TOP doesn't filter by conditions - use WHERE for that

## Practice Questions

| PlayerID | PlayerName | Runs | Matches |
|----------|------------|------|---------|
| 1 | Virat | 180 | 5 |

| 3 | Dhoni | 120 | 4 |
| 4 | Hardik | 95 | 3 |
| 5 | Rahul | 150 | 5 |

**Question 1:** Find top 2 run scorers.

```sql
SELECT TOP 2 PlayerName, Runs

**Expected Output:**
| PlayerName | Runs |
|------------|------|
| Virat | 180 |
| Rohit | 165 |

---

**Question 2:** Find player with lowest runs.

## Quick Summary

**TOP = Control How Many Rows!**

- Limits number of rows in results
- Goes right after SELECT
- Combine with ORDER BY for top/bottom analysis
- Different databases use TOP or LIMIT
- Great for rankings and reports

**Remember:** TOP is like a scissors ✂️ - it cuts your results to show only the number you want!

---

**Pro Tip:** Always use TOP with ORDER BY to get meaningful results. Otherwise, you're just getting random rows from the top of the table!
