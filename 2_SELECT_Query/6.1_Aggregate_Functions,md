# SQL Aggregate Functions - A Beginner's Guide

## What are Aggregate Functions?

Imagine you have a box full of different colored marbles, and you want to count them or find the average size. Aggregate functions in SQL work similarly - they take many values and give you one answer!

**Simple Definition:** Aggregate functions take multiple rows of data and combine them to give you a single result.

## The 5 Most Common Aggregate Functions

### 1. **COUNT** - Counts how many items you have
### 2. **SUM** - Adds up all the numbers
### 3. **AVG** - Finds the average (mean) value
### 4. **MAX** - Finds the largest value
### 5. **MIN** - Finds the smallest value

## Let's Learn with Examples!

Imagine we have a table called **students** with test scores:

| student_id | student_name | math_score |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| 1 | Alice | 85 |
| 2 | Bob | 92 |
| 3 | Charlie | 78 |
| 4 | Diana | 95 |
| 5 | Eve | 88 |

---

### Example 1: COUNT - How many students took the test?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
```

**Output:**
```
count
-----
5
```

**Explanation:** This counts all the rows in the table. We have 5 students!

---

### Example 2: MIN - What's the lowest score?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT MIN(math_score) FROM students;
```

**Output:**
```
min
---
78
```

**Explanation:** The smallest score in the table is 78 (Charlie's score).

---

### Example 3: MAX - What's the highest score?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT MAX(math_score) FROM students;
```

**Output:**
```
max
---
95
```

**Explanation:** The highest score is 95 (Diana's score).

---

### Example 4: SUM - What's the total of all scores?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(math_score) FROM students;
```

**Output:**
```
sum
---
438
```

**Explanation:** If we add 85 + 92 + 78 + 95 + 88 = 438

---

### Example 5: AVG - What's the average score?

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(math_score) FROM students;
```

**Output:**
```
avg
-----------------
87.6000000000000
```

**Explanation:** The average is 438 Ã· 5 = 87.6, but SQL shows many decimal places!

---

### Example 6: ROUND with AVG - Making the average look nicer

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(math_score), 2) FROM students;
```

**Output:**
```
round
-----
87.60
```

**Explanation:** The ROUND function makes the number show only 2 decimal places. The "2" tells SQL how many digits after the decimal point we want.

## Important Things to Remember! ðŸŽ¯

1. **Aggregate functions turn many values into ONE value**
2. **You can only use them in SELECT or HAVING clauses** (we'll learn HAVING later!)
3. **COUNT(*) counts all rows** - you can use * or a column name
4. **AVG gives lots of decimal places** - use ROUND to make it cleaner
5. **You can't mix regular columns with aggregate functions** (unless you use GROUP BY, which we'll learn next!)

## Practice Question

If we had a **books** table like this:

| book_id | title | price |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Mystery Book | 12.99 |
| 2 | Science Book | 15.50 |
| 3 | Story Book | 9.99 |

**What would this query return?**
```sql
SELECT SUM(price) FROM books;
```

**Answer:** 38.48 (because 12.99 + 15.50 + 9.99 = 38.48)

---

## Summary

Aggregate functions are like mathematical tools that help you analyze your data:
- **COUNT** = How many?
- **SUM** = What's the total?
- **AVG** = What's the average?
- **MAX** = What's the biggest?
- **MIN** = What's the smallest?

Next, you'll learn about **GROUP BY**, which lets you use these functions on different groups of data at the same time!
