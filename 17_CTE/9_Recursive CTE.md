# Recursive CTEs - The Looping Magic!
*When a CTE Calls Itself Again and Again*

## What is a Recursive CTE?

A **Recursive CTE** is like a CTE that can **call itself** multiple times until it finishes a task!

Think of it like climbing stairs:
- You start at step 1
- Then you go to step 2
- Then step 3, 4, 5...
- You keep going until you reach the top!

**Key Difference:**

| Type | Executes | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Non-Recursive CTE** | Once | Normal CTEs we learned |
| **Recursive CTE** | Multiple times (loops!) | Keeps running until done |

---

## How Does It Work?

```
DATABASE ‚Üí CTE (1st time) ‚Üí Check condition ‚Üí Not done? ‚Üí CTE (2nd time) ‚Üí Check ‚Üí Not done? ‚Üí CTE (3rd time) ‚Üí Check ‚Üí Done! ‚Üí MAIN QUERY
```

**The Process:**
1. CTE executes and creates initial results
2. Checks: "Are we done?"
3. If NO ‚Üí Execute CTE again (adds more data)
4. Keep looping until condition says "YES, we're done!"
5. Pass final results to main query

---

## When Do We Use Recursive CTEs?

We use them for:
- üìä **Hierarchical data** (company org charts, family trees)
- üî¢ **Sequences** (generating number lists)
- üå≥ **Tree structures** (folders, categories)
- üìà **Level-based data** (game levels, school grades)

## Recursive CTE Structure

```sql
WITH CTE_Name AS (
    -- Part 1: ANCHOR QUERY (runs once)
    SELECT ... -- Starting point
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Part 2: RECURSIVE QUERY (loops)
    SELECT ... -- References itself!
    FROM CTE_Name -- ‚Üê Calls itself!
    WHERE condition -- ‚Üê Breaking condition
)
SELECT * FROM CTE_Name;
```

**Two Parts:**
1. **Anchor Query** = Starting point (runs ONCE)
2. **Recursive Query** = Looping part (runs MULTIPLE times)

---

## Simple Example 1: Generate Numbers 1 to 10

Let's create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10!

```sql
WITH NumberSequence AS (
    -- ANCHOR QUERY: Start with 1
    SELECT 1 as num
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- RECURSIVE QUERY: Keep adding 1
    SELECT num + 1
    FROM NumberSequence
    WHERE num < 10  -- Stop at 10
)
SELECT * FROM NumberSequence;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
num
---
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

**What Happened:**
1. **Anchor:** Started with 1
2. **Loop 1:** 1 + 1 = 2
3. **Loop 2:** 2 + 1 = 3
4. **Loop 3:** 3 + 1 = 4
5. ... continues until 10
6. **Stop:** When num = 10 (not < 10 anymore)

---

## How It Executes Step-by-Step

Let's trace through the first few iterations:

**Iteration 0 (Anchor):**
```
Result: [1]
Check: Is 1 < 10? YES ‚Üí Continue
```

**Iteration 1 (Recursive):**
```
Current: 1
Calculate: 1 + 1 = 2
Result: [1, 2]
Check: Is 2 < 10? YES ‚Üí Continue
```

**Iteration 2 (Recursive):**
```
Current: 2
Calculate: 2 + 1 = 3
Result: [1, 2, 3]
Check: Is 3 < 10? YES ‚Üí Continue
```

**... keeps going ...**

**Iteration 9 (Recursive):**
```
Current: 10
Check: Is 10 < 10? NO ‚Üí STOP!
Final Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

---

## Example 2: Counting Down from 20

```sql
WITH Countdown AS (
    -- Start at 20
    SELECT 20 as number
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Subtract 1 each time
    SELECT number - 1
    FROM Countdown
    WHERE number > 1  -- Stop at 1
)
SELECT * FROM Countdown;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
number
------
20
19
18
17
...
3
2
1
```

---

## Controlling Recursion Limit

SQL has a default limit of 100 iterations. You can change it:

```sql
WITH NumberSequence AS (
    SELECT 1 as num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT num + 1
    FROM NumberSequence
    WHERE num < 1000  -- Want 1000 numbers
)
SELECT * FROM NumberSequence
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 5000);  -- Allow up to 5000 loops
```

**Without setting limit:** Error after 100 iterations  
**With MAXRECURSION 5000:** Can go up to 5000 iterations

## Real-World Example: School Class Hierarchy

### Our Table: Students
```
student_id | name    | mentor_id | level
-----------|---------|-----------|------
1          | Alice   | NULL      | NULL
2          | Bob     | 1         | NULL
3          | Charlie | 1         | NULL
4          | Diana   | 2         | NULL
5          | Emma    | 3         | NULL
```

**Structure:**
- Alice is the class monitor (no mentor)
- Bob and Charlie report to Alice
- Diana reports to Bob
- Emma reports to Charlie

---

### Task: Show Student Hierarchy Levels

```sql
WITH StudentHierarchy AS (
    -- ANCHOR: Start with class monitor (no mentor)
    SELECT 
        student_id,
        name,
        mentor_id,
        1 as level  -- Top level
    FROM students
    WHERE mentor_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- RECURSIVE: Find students under each level
    SELECT 
        s.student_id,
        s.name,
        s.mentor_id,
        sh.level + 1  -- Next level down
    FROM students s
    INNER JOIN StudentHierarchy sh 
        ON s.mentor_id = sh.student_id
)
SELECT * FROM StudentHierarchy
ORDER BY level, student_id;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
student_id | name    | mentor_id | level
-----------|---------|-----------|------
1          | Alice   | NULL      | 1
2          | Bob     | 1         | 2
3          | Charlie | 1         | 2
4          | Diana   | 2         | 3
5          | Emma    | 3         | 3
```

**Visual Hierarchy:**
```
        Level 1: Alice (Class Monitor)
                  /    \
        Level 2: Bob    Charlie
                  |        |
        Level 3: Diana   Emma
```

---

## How the Hierarchy Query Works

**Step 1: Anchor Query**
```
Find: Students with no mentor (Alice)
Result: [Alice, Level 1]
```

**Step 2: First Recursion**
```
Find: Students whose mentor_id = 1 (Alice's ID)
Match: Bob and Charlie
Result: [Alice-1, Bob-2, Charlie-2]
```

**Step 3: Second Recursion**
```
Find: Students whose mentor_id = 2 or 3
Match: Diana (mentor=2) and Emma (mentor=3)
Result: [Alice-1, Bob-2, Charlie-2, Diana-3, Emma-3]
```

**Step 4: Third Recursion**
```
Find: Students whose mentor_id = 4 or 5
Match: None found
Result: STOP! We're done.
```

## Example 3: Company Employee Hierarchy

### Our Table: Employees
```
employee_id | name    | manager_id
------------|---------|------------
1           | Frank   | NULL
2           | Kevin   | 1
3           | Mary    | 1
4           | Michael | 2
5           | Carol   | 3
```

**Company Structure:**
- Frank = CEO (no manager)
- Kevin and Mary report to Frank
- Michael reports to Kevin
- Carol reports to Mary

---

### Query: Show Employee Levels

```sql
WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    -- ANCHOR: CEO (no manager)
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        name,
        manager_id,
        1 as level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- RECURSIVE: Find all subordinates
    SELECT 
        e.employee_id,
        e.name,
        e.manager_id,
        eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh 
        ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy
ORDER BY level, name;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
employee_id | name    | manager_id | level
------------|---------|------------|------
1           | Frank   | NULL       | 1
2           | Kevin   | 1          | 2
3           | Mary    | 1          | 2
4           | Michael | 2          | 3
5           | Carol   | 3          | 3
```

**Org Chart:**
```
Level 1:        Frank (CEO)
                 /    \
Level 2:    Kevin    Mary
              |        |
Level 3:   Michael   Carol
```

## Example 4: Generate Multiplication Table

```sql
WITH MultiplicationTable AS (
    -- Start with 5 x 1
    SELECT 5 as number, 1 as multiplier, 5*1 as result
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Keep multiplying
    SELECT 
        5,
        multiplier + 1,
        5 * (multiplier + 1)
    FROM MultiplicationTable
    WHERE multiplier < 10
)
SELECT 
    number,
    multiplier,
    result,
    CONCAT(number, ' x ', multiplier, ' = ', result) as equation
FROM MultiplicationTable;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
number | multiplier | result | equation
-------|------------|--------|------------
5      | 1          | 5      | 5 x 1 = 5
5      | 2          | 10     | 5 x 2 = 10
5      | 3          | 15     | 5 x 3 = 15
5      | 4          | 20     | 5 x 4 = 20
5      | 5          | 25     | 5 x 5 = 25
...
5      | 10         | 50     | 5 x 10 = 50
```

## Important Rules for Recursive CTEs

### ‚úÖ Must Have:
1. **Anchor Query** - Starting point
2. **UNION ALL** - Connects anchor and recursive parts
3. **Recursive Query** - References itself
4. **Breaking Condition** - WHERE clause to stop loop

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Watch Out For:
- **Infinite loops** - Always have a stopping condition!
- **Default limit** - 100 iterations max (use MAXRECURSION to change)
- **Performance** - Too many loops = slow query

---

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: No Breaking Condition
```sql
WITH InfiniteLoop AS (
    SELECT 1 as num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT num + 1 FROM InfiniteLoop
    -- Missing WHERE! Will run forever!
)
SELECT * FROM InfiniteLoop;
-- ERROR: Max recursion reached!
```

### ‚úÖ Fixed: Add WHERE Condition
```sql
WITH ProperLoop AS (
    SELECT 1 as num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT num + 1 FROM ProperLoop
    WHERE num < 10  -- Stops at 10
)
SELECT * FROM ProperLoop;
```

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Non-Recursive CTE | Recursive CTE |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Executions | Once | Multiple (loops) |
| References itself | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Has UNION ALL | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Has Anchor Query | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Use for | Simple queries | Hierarchies, sequences |

## Key Takeaways

üìå **Recursive CTE** = CTE that calls itself  
üìå **Two parts** = Anchor (start) + Recursive (loop)  
üìå **UNION ALL** = Connects both parts  
üìå **Breaking condition** = WHERE clause to stop  
üìå **Use for hierarchies** = Org charts, family trees  
üìå **Use for sequences** = Number lists, patterns  
üìå **Default limit** = 100 loops (changeable)  

---

## Practice Challenge

Create a recursive CTE that:
1. Starts at 2
2. Multiplies by 2 each time (2, 4, 8, 16...)
3. Stops at 128

**Hint:** Start with 2, then multiply current number by 2!

**Try it yourself!** üöÄ
