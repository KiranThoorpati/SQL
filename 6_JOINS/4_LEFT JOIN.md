# SQL LEFT JOIN - Easy Guide for Beginners

## What is a LEFT JOIN?

A **LEFT JOIN** returns ALL rows from the left table and only the MATCHING rows from the right table. If there's no match, you'll see NULL values.

Think of it like this:
- **Left Table** = Your main source (we need EVERYTHING from here)
- **Right Table** = Extra information (we only take what matches)

## Visual Example

```
Table A (Left)          Table B (Right)
    ‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè                  ‚óè‚óè‚óè
      FULL CIRCLE          ONLY MATCHING PART
```

## Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM left_table A
LEFT JOIN right_table B
ON A.key = B.key;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The order of tables matters! Always start with the table you want ALL data from.

## Real Example: Customers and Orders

### Our Tables

**Customers Table:**
```
CustomerID | FirstName
-----------|----------
1          | John
2          | Sarah
3          | Mike
4          | Martin
5          | Peter
```

**Orders Table:**
```
OrderID | CustomerID | Sales
--------|------------|-------
101     | 1          | 500
102     | 2          | 300
103     | 3          | 450
```

### Task
Get all customers along with their orders, **including those without orders**.

### ‚ùå Wrong Way - INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT 
    Customers.CustomerID,
    Customers.FirstName,
    Orders.OrderID,
    Orders.Sales
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**Output:**
```
CustomerID | FirstName | OrderID | Sales
-----------|-----------|---------|-------
1          | John      | 101     | 500
2          | Sarah     | 102     | 300
3          | Mike      | 103     | 450
```

**Problem:** Martin and Peter are missing! ‚ùå

### ‚úÖ Correct Way - LEFT JOIN

```sql
SELECT 
    Customers.CustomerID,
    Customers.FirstName,
    Orders.OrderID,
    Orders.Sales
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**Output:**
```
CustomerID | FirstName | OrderID | Sales
-----------|-----------|---------|-------
1          | John      | 101     | 500
2          | Sarah     | 102     | 300
3          | Mike      | 103     | 450
4          | Martin    | NULL    | NULL
5          | Peter     | NULL    | NULL
```

**Success:** All 5 customers are shown! Martin and Peter have NULL because they didn't place any orders. ‚úÖ

## How SQL Executes LEFT JOIN (Step-by-Step)

1. **Start with left table** (Customers)
2. **Add each row immediately** to results (no checking needed!)
3. **Search for matching data** in right table (Orders)
4. **If match found** ‚Üí Add order details
5. **If NO match found** ‚Üí Add NULL values

### Example Flow:

- **John (ID=1)**: Found in Orders ‚Üí Shows OrderID 101, Sales 500
- **Sarah (ID=2)**: Found in Orders ‚Üí Shows OrderID 102, Sales 300
- **Mike (ID=3)**: Found in Orders ‚Üí Shows OrderID 103, Sales 450
- **Martin (ID=4)**: NOT found in Orders ‚Üí Shows NULL, NULL
- **Peter (ID=5)**: NOT found in Orders ‚Üí Shows NULL, NULL

## Common Mistake: Switching Tables ‚ö†Ô∏è

```sql
-- WRONG ORDER!
SELECT *
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

This will show **all orders** but might miss some customers. Not what we wanted!

## Key Points to Remember

‚úÖ LEFT JOIN keeps ALL rows from the first table (left table)  
‚úÖ NULL appears when there's no matching data  
‚úÖ Order of tables is VERY important  
‚úÖ Always start FROM the table you want complete data from  
‚úÖ Use it when you have a main table and need extra information from another table

## Practice Question

If a school has:
- **Students table**: 10 students
- **Library Books table**: Only 6 students borrowed books

Which JOIN would you use to see ALL students and show who borrowed books?

**Answer:** LEFT JOIN (starting from Students table) so you don't miss any student! üìö
