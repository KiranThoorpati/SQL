# SQL FULL JOIN - Easy Guide for Beginners

## What is a FULL JOIN?

A **FULL JOIN** returns **EVERYTHING** from BOTH tables - all rows from the left table AND all rows from the right table, whether they match or not!

Think of it like this:
- **Left Table** = Get EVERYTHING (the whole circle)
- **Right Table** = Get EVERYTHING (the whole circle)
- Both tables are equally important!

## Visual Example

```
Table A (Left)          Table B (Right)
    ‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè                 ‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè
   FULL CIRCLE             FULL CIRCLE
      ALL DATA    +    ALL DATA
```

## Basic Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table_A
FULL JOIN table_B
ON A.key = B.key;
```

‚úÖ **Great News:** The order of tables doesn't matter! Both give the same result:
- `FROM A FULL JOIN B` = Same as `FROM B FULL JOIN A`

## Real Example: Customers and Orders

### Our Tables

**Customers Table:**
```
CustomerID | FirstName
-----------|----------
1          | John
2          | Sarah
3          | Mike
4          | Martin
5          | Peter
```

**Orders Table:**
```
OrderID | CustomerID | Sales
--------|------------|-------
101     | 1          | 500
102     | 2          | 300
103     | 3          | 450
104     | NULL       | 200
```

### Task
Get all customers and all orders, **even if there is no match**.

### ‚úÖ Solution - FULL JOIN

```sql
SELECT 
    Customers.CustomerID,
    Customers.FirstName,
    Orders.OrderID,
    Orders.Sales
FROM Customers
FULL JOIN Orders
ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;
```

**Output:**
```
CustomerID | FirstName | OrderID | Sales
-----------|-----------|---------|-------
1          | John      | 101     | 500
2          | Sarah     | 102     | 300
3          | Mike      | 103     | 450
4          | Martin    | NULL    | NULL
5          | Peter     | NULL    | NULL
NULL       | NULL      | 104     | 200
```

**Perfect!** ‚úÖ
- All 5 customers are shown (including Martin and Peter with no orders)
- All 4 orders are shown (including Order 104 with no customer)
- NULL appears when there's no match on either side

## How SQL Executes FULL JOIN (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Get Everything from Left Table First
```
1 - John
2 - Sarah  
3 - Mike
4 - Martin
5 - Peter
```

### Step 2: Find Matching Orders
- **John (ID=1)**: Has Order 101 ‚Üí Add Sales 500
- **Sarah (ID=2)**: Has Order 102 ‚Üí Add Sales 300
- **Mike (ID=3)**: Has Order 103 ‚Üí Add Sales 450
- **Martin (ID=4)**: No orders ‚Üí Add NULL, NULL
- **Peter (ID=5)**: No orders ‚Üí Add NULL, NULL

### Step 3: Check for Unmatched Orders
- Order 101 ‚úì Already in output
- Order 102 ‚úì Already in output
- Order 103 ‚úì Already in output
- **Order 104 ‚úó NOT in output yet!**

### Step 4: Add Missing Order
Add Order 104 with NULL for customer info:
```
NULL | NULL | 104 | 200
```

## Comparison with Other JOINs

Using the same tables, let's see the difference:

### INNER JOIN (Only Matches)
```sql
FROM Customers INNER JOIN Orders
```
**Result:** 3 rows (only John, Sarah, Mike with their orders)

### LEFT JOIN (All from Left)
```sql
FROM Customers LEFT JOIN Orders
```
**Result:** 5 rows (all customers, Order 104 missing)

### RIGHT JOIN (All from Right)
```sql
FROM Customers RIGHT JOIN Orders
```
**Result:** 4 rows (all orders, Martin and Peter missing)

### FULL JOIN (Everything!)
```sql
FROM Customers FULL JOIN Orders
```
**Result:** 6 rows (EVERYONE and EVERYTHING!)

## Another Example: School Library

### Tables

**Students:**
```
StudentID | Name
----------|--------
1         | Amy
2         | Bob
3         | Chris
```

**Books Borrowed:**
```
BookID | StudentID | BookName
-------|-----------|-------------
201    | 1         | Harry Potter
202    | 2         | Math Guide
203    | NULL      | Science Book
```

### FULL JOIN Query

```sql
SELECT 
    Students.StudentID,
    Students.Name,
    Books.BookID,
    Books.BookName
FROM Students
FULL JOIN Books
ON Students.StudentID = Books.StudentID;
```

### Output:
```
StudentID | Name  | BookID | BookName
----------|-------|--------|-------------
1         | Amy   | 201    | Harry Potter
2         | Bob   | 202    | Math Guide
3         | Chris | NULL   | NULL
NULL      | NULL  | 203    | Science Book
```

**What we see:**
- Amy borrowed Harry Potter ‚úÖ
- Bob borrowed Math Guide ‚úÖ
- Chris didn't borrow anything (NULL for books) ‚úÖ
- Someone borrowed Science Book but we don't know who (NULL for student) ‚úÖ

## Key Points to Remember

‚úÖ FULL JOIN shows ALL data from BOTH tables  
‚úÖ NULL appears when there's no match on either side  
‚úÖ Table order doesn't matter (unlike LEFT/RIGHT JOIN)  
‚úÖ Both tables are equally important  
‚úÖ You get matching data + unmatched data from left + unmatched data from right  
‚úÖ Use it when you don't want to lose ANY information from either table

## Quick JOIN Summary Table

| JOIN Type | What You Get |
|-----------|--------------|
| **INNER JOIN** | Only matching rows |
| **LEFT JOIN** | Everything from LEFT + matches from RIGHT |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | Everything from RIGHT + matches from LEFT |
| **FULL JOIN** | **EVERYTHING from BOTH tables** |

## Practice Question

A game has:
- **Players table**: 8 players registered
- **Scores table**: Only 5 players have played games

You want to see:
- All players (even if they haven't played)
- All scores (even if player info is missing)

**Which JOIN should you use?**

**Answer:** FULL JOIN! This way you won't miss any player OR any score! üéÆ

---

## üéØ When to Use FULL JOIN?

Use FULL JOIN when:
- You need a complete picture from both tables
- You don't want to lose any data from either side
- Both tables are equally important
- You're doing data analysis and need to see everything

**Example uses:** Finding mismatches, data audits, complete reports! üìä
